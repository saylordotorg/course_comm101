**Unit 6: Researching Your Speech** <span id="6"></span> 
**In the introduction to the chapter in the textbook which covers the
topic of research, the authors emphasize an entity whose role in society
is being usurped by other developments.  That entity is the librarian
and the most influential of those “other developments” is the Internet. 
Pursuing accurate, ethical, and relevant research today is complicated
by the sheer number of sources of information that is now available.  In
the past, libraries and librarians acted as gatekeepers to screen out
many flawed or misleading sources of information; today, however, access
to the Internet gives the researcher the freedom to make his or her own
choices, regardless of whether that individual is adequately prepared to
do so.  As this issue becomes increasingly important, educators are
emphasizing information literacy as a “core” skill—like public
speaking—which is a requisite for success in the information-driven,
information-overloaded world we live and work in today.**

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 5 hours to complete.

    Flashcards"](http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/007313564x/student_view0/chapter6/key-term_flashcards.html) (Adobe
    Flash)  
        
     Instructions: After you have completed all of the readings,
    lectures, and other resources for this unit, respond to all 18
    key-term flashcards linked above.  Click on “Instructions” in the
    shaded bar below the flashcard, and follow the directions and
    options described.  If at any point in reviewing the flashcards you
    are unsure of the answer, refer to the course textbook, Lucas’
    textbook’s summary or outline pages, and/or perform an Internet
    search to uncover the answer.  Be aware that if you discover the
    terms used deviate significantly from the textbook readings or the
    lecture, you can click on “Key Terms” in the shaded bar to see the
    complete list of terms and definitions for the set of flashcards.
     After you have reviewed that list, click on “Start Over” to re-test
    yourself. Keep in mind that you can choose to a.) see the term and
    provide the definition or b.) see the definition and provide the
    term by toggling the box to the left of the phrase “key term first,”
    located on the right-hand side of the pink shaded bar.  To check the
    accuracy of your answers, click on the word “flip” in the lower
    right-hand corner of the flashcard.  This action will turn the card
    over and prompt the system to announce the correct term.  If your
    response was incorrect, click on flashcard box labeled “study
    again.”  This will save the term for you to return to later and then
    turn over a new flashcard.  Once you have completed all of the
    flashcards in the set, if you got any of them incorrect, consider
    reviewing the chapter summary, the reading assignments, and/or the
    lecture again before you click on any of the unshaded boxes in the
    row at the bottom of the flashcard.  The unshaded boxes represent
    key terms you did not identify correctly in your previous attempt
    and give you the opportunity to reinforce your learning experience
    by revisiting those terms.
