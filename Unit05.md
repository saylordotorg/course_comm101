**Unit 5: Finding a Purpose and Selecting a Topic** <span
id="5"></span> 
**More often than not, the purpose and topic of your speech will be
determined for you by outside factors such as the context of your speech
and its audience.  Nevertheless, it remains your responsibility to
narrow the topic of your speech such that it suits the nature of your
audience, your own interests, and other factors associated with the
setting and occasion.  This unit examines all of the elements in the
speech context which should influence your decisions. The operational
word in the preceding sentence, however, is “should.” Many inexperienced
speakers do not take the time to fully analyze those elements which
“should” determine the nature of their speech.  The relationship between
purpose and audience is one example of this problem.  The only time an
effective communicator does not analyze his or her audience with respect
to the purpose of a speech is when he or she does not care how an
audience receives or reacts to its message.  To understand how important
this is, consider the four goals of communication, three of which you
will encounter in this course: to inform, to persuade, to entertain, and
to express.  Teachers inform, politicians persuade, comedians entertain,
but who expresses?  One answer could be artists.  What impact does a
poet seek in presenting a poem?  To answer that, consider first what
impact a communicator has with the other types: to inform someone of
something, to persuade someone to do something, to entertain someone. 
But there is no “someone” at the other end of “to express,” is there? 
And what about communicators who are not artists, but who also seek to
express themselves anyway?  One example of this occurs when an angry
person swears.  The problem that arises with expression, which could be
defined as communicating with no consideration of context or audience,
is that the speaker has little control over the effects, as the
frequently offensive nature of swearing illustrates. In this unit, you
will study the various purposes of speech-giving, as well as tips and
suggestions for selecting a topic for your speech.**

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 5.25 hours to complete.

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:  
  
-   Identify the general purpose of a speech based on its content.
-   Recognize the common forms of informative, persuasive, and
    entertaining speeches.
-   Name the four primary constraints of topic selection.
-   Describe relationships between a speaker’s traits, audience polling,
    topic selection and the purpose of a speech.
-   Choose the most appropriate tip for creating specific purposes under
    a given circumstance.

Entertain** <span id="5.1"></span>

    Speaking”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Stand%20Up,%20Speak%20Out%20-%20The%20Practice%20and%20Ethics%20of%20Public%20Speaking.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please read both the Chapter 6 introduction and
    Section 6.1 in their entirety, paying particular attention to the
    sample speeches presented for each type of purpose.  At the end of
    the reading, attempt to answer the questions in the Exercises
    section.  The challenge for many first-time speakers is putting the
    parts of a speech together.  Learning what the parts are is easy,
    but understanding how one part influences another is not an
    intuitive matter for most.  This is why the best way to proceed is
    to read speech transcripts, such as in this section, and also to
    watch speech videos, as this course emphasizes in its web media
    links.  Note that this reading covers the topics in subunits 5.1.1
    through 5.1.3.

**5.1.1 To Inform** <span id="5.1.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 5.1. 
To cover this topic of one of the general purposes of giving a speech,
you should note the distinguishing features of each of the six common
types of informative topics: objects, people, events, concepts,
processes, and issues.  This topic is introduced in a subheading in the
“Section 6.1: General Purposes of Speaking” reading.*

**5.1.2 To Persuade** <span id="5.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 5.1. 
In reading this material, make sure you are connecting manipulative
persuasion with unethical practices, even though the reading does not
emphasize that relationship. In addition, pay particular attention to
the two objectives of persuasion: to change behavior or to change
attitudes, values, or beliefs.  It is also important that you understand
how values differ from beliefs, how core beliefs differ from
dispositional belief, and which of each set is more difficult to change.
 This topic is introduced by a subheading in the “Section 6.1: General
Purposes of Speaking” reading.*

**5.1.3 To Entertain** <span id="5.1.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 5.1. 
To cover the topic of entertaining as one of the general purposes of
giving a speech, you should note the distinguishing features of each of
the three common types of speeches to entertain: the after-dinner
speech, the ceremonial speech, and the inspirational speech.  This topic
is introduced by a subheading in the “Section 6.1: General Purposes of
Speaking” reading.*  

**5.2 Selecting a Topic** <span id="5.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: Stand up, Speak out: The Practice and Ethics of Public
    Speaking: “Chapter 6, Section 6.2: Selecting a Topic”**
    Link: *Stand up, Speak out: The Practice and Ethics of Public

    Topic”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Stand%20Up,%20Speak%20Out%20-%20The%20Practice%20and%20Ethics%20of%20Public%20Speaking.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please read the entire Section 6.2, which ends with a
    set of questions about how appropriately you have chosen your
    topic.  The questions are very important, because topics which are
    poorly chosen are difficult to develop and to deliver.  This is why,
    before you put a lot of time into a topic, you should be disciplined
    in answering the four questions posed in this section.  Neglecting
    this step can result in a lot of wasted time and effort.  In fact,
    this step is so important in developing a speech that it will be
    revisited briefly in Unit 7 in which some duplication of this
    content will occur.  However, Unit 7 includes additional examples
    and helpful quizzes which will serve to reinforce the suggestions
    made in this reading assignment.  After you complete the reading, it
    may help to reinforce what you’ve learned by attempting the
    Exercises provided in Section 2.  Please note that this reading
    covers the topics outlined in subunits 5.2.1 through 5.2.3, as well
    as any inclusive sections.

     Instructions: Please read the entire Section 6.3, which includes a
    rarely covered aspect of public speaking: making adjustments to a
    speech while delivering it.  Most of this section discusses how
    audience analysis is used to prepare a speech, but you should not
    neglect opportunities to improve your speech by noticing the
    feedback audiences can provide while you are speaking.  This is
    another area which you are encouraged to consider carefully and
    apply to the scenarios you may encounter in assignments.  It may
    help reinforce your understanding to attempt the questions in the
    Exercise section at the end of the reading; for questions like
    number 4 that asks to get feedback from your class, consider getting
    feedback from another known audience (i.e. family members or
    friends) before presenting a speech.  Note that this reading covers
    the topics outlined in subunits 5.3.1 through 5.3.3, as well as any
    inclusive sections.

     Instructions: After you have completed all of the readings,
    lectures, and other resources for this unit, respond to all 7
    key-term flashcards linked above.  Click on “Instructions” in the
    shaded bar below the flashcard, and follow the directions and
    options described.  If at any point in reviewing the flashcards you
    are unsure of the answer, refer to the course textbook, Lucas’
    textbook’s summary or outline pages, and/or perform an Internet
    search to uncover the answer.  Be aware that if you discover the
    terms used deviate significantly from the textbook readings or the
    lecture, you can click on “Key Terms” in the shaded bar to see the
    complete list of terms and definitions for the set of flashcards. 
    After you have reviewed that list, click on “Start Over” to re-test
    yourself. Keep in mind that you can choose to a.) see the term and
    provide the definition or b.) see the definition and provide the
    term by toggling the box to the left of the phrase “key term first,”
    located on the right-hand side of the pink shaded bar.  To check the
    accuracy of your answers, click on the word “flip” in the lower
    right-hand corner of the flashcard.  This action will turn the card
    over and prompt the system to announce the correct term.  If your
    response was incorrect, click on flashcard box labeled “study
    again.”  This will save the term for you to return to later and then
    turn over a new flashcard.  Once you have completed all of the
    flashcards in the set, if you got any of them incorrect, consider
    reviewing the chapter summary, the reading assignments, and/or the
    lecture again before you click on any of the unshaded boxes in the
    row at the bottom of the flashcard.  The unshaded boxes represent
    key terms you did not identify correctly in your previous attempt
    and give you the opportunity to reinforce your learning experience
    by revisiting those terms.

    the quiz.  Notice that any questions you answered incorrectly will
    include a green check mark identifying the correct answer, as well
    as an explanation for that answer presented in bold-faced type.  You
    can also check your answers to the open-ended questions at the end
    of the quiz by comparing them to the bold-faced text which will
    appear in the answer field.  (Note, however, that only the
    multiple-choice questions are used to calculate your actual quiz
    score.)
