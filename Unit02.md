**Unit 2: Speaking Confidently** <span id="2"></span> 
**Unfortunately, understanding the anxiety which you may experience
about public speaking does not necessarily help to alleviate it.
 However, as this unit of the course emphasizes, recognizing how your
anxiety manifests itself in your behavior and then being able to try out
a few recommendations for managing it can at least make you feel more
empowered to carry on regardless.  This unit will explore what is
communication apprehension, where it comes from, and suggestions and
tips on how it can be minimized.**

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 5 hours to complete.

**2.3.1 Speech Related Considerations** <span id="2.3.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 2.3. 
To get the most out of this material, consider how the three
considerations which can impact speaking anxiety—positive thinking,
preparation, and delivery nervousness—apply to your own, personal public
speaking characteristics.  Upon completing the reading, consider
prioritizing those considerations so you can plan to spend more time on
the one(s) most relevant to your situation. * *Each consideration is
introduced by a subheading in the “Section 3.3: Reducing Communication
Apprehension” reading.*

**2.3.2 Stress Management Techniques** <span id="2.3.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 2.3
and presents two ways to manage the stress that leads to communication
anxiety: positive visualization and systematic desensitization.  As you
cover this material, think back to Michael Motley’s classroom lecture
(subunit 2.3), and note how many of his recommendations correspond to
one of these methods.*

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please read this brief Section 3.4, which discusses
    some common difficulties speakers face and therefore should
    anticipate and prepare for.  Knowing that such things are likely to
    occur at some point when you are speaking can also help to alleviate
    some of your apprehension.  Attempt the exercises at the end of the
    reading.
