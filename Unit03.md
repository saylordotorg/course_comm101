**Unit 3: The Importance of Listening** <span id="3"></span> 
**Every speech course includes a unit on listening, even though most
people do not associate the subjects with each other.  Yet, it is very
important that you associate listening habits with public speaking
skills and public speaking presentations.  A well-known saying is that
you should “walk a mile in another man’s shoes” in order to understand
that person.  That also applies to speech audiences; you need to imagine
what it would be like to be your own audience.  This means assessing
your personal listening habits as well as those of your anticipated
audience.  Unit 4 introduces audience analysis as one of the ways to
proceed with that assessment, but in this unit, the focus is on the
general traits possessed by all listeners and how you should plan your
speech with those traits in mind. **

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 5.5 hours to complete.

benefits is introduced by a subheading in the “Section 4.1: Listening
vs. Hearing” reading.*

    by using techniques that appeal to a particular style.  Attempt the
    exercises at the end of the reading; it may help to work with a
    group of friends or family members to address question 1.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please read all of Section 4.3, which focuses on
    factors that can interfere with effective listening, which the
    textbook defines as “noise.”  One way to remember what noise refers
    to is also a memorable definition: noise is anything which
    interferes with the transmission, reception, comprehension, or
    retention of a message.  As with all of the material in this fourth
    chapter of the textbook, the point of this section is to provide
    information for a speaker to use in preparing for a speech. 
    Understanding listening behaviors enables a speaker to modify the
    content or the environment of a speech to minimize the negative
    effects of poor listening habits or circumstances.  Attempt the
    exercises at the end of the reading; it may help to work with a
    group of friends or family members to address question 1.

**3.3.4 Listening or Receiver Apprehension** <span id="3.3.4"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 3.3. 
To understand how to reduce this type of apprehension in yourself or an
audience, the first step is to pay attention to how the emotion is
defined in the textbook: “the fear that you might be unable to
understand the message or process the information correctly or be able
to adapt your thinking to include the new information coherently."  This
material is introduced by a subheading in the “Section 4.3: Why
Listening Is Difficult” reading.*

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please read all of Section 4.4, which points out how
    listening, like speaking, is a process.  A good speaker can develop
    content that uses the stages of listening to enhance how a message
    is perceived, understood, and retained.  You can also trace
    miscommunication to listening stages and use those stages, as well
    as the audience feedback this section covers, to enhance the impact
    of your speech.  Attempt the exercises after you have completed the
    reading.

     Instructions: Please read Section 4.5 in its entirety.  When you
    read this section of the textbook, be aware that the term “critical
    listening” is more commonly referred to as “active listening.”  What
    every speaker wants is an audience which is engaged, actively taking
    in information, analyzing, and judging it as it pertains to each
    individual’s situation.  You can appreciate this even more by being
    an active listener yourself.  This section describes a number of
    actions you can take to improve your listening habits.  Attempt the
    exercises at the end of the reading.

Figure 4.1, which makes important distinctions between facts and
assumptions that many listeners tend to overlook.  Each technique in
this subunit is introduced by a subheading in the “Section 4.5:
Listening Critically” reading. *

**3.5.2 Listening Ethically** <span id="3.5.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 3.5. 
It is important that you keep in mind the cultural differences through
which you, or others, may interpret what the textbook refers to as
“honest intentions” and “decency.” However, using the same
interpretation is not as important as recognizing how an audience that
listens helpfully rather than harmfully can influence a speaker's
performance and effectiveness.*

    (Adobe Flash)  
        
     Instructions:  After you have completed all of the readings,
    lectures, and other resources for this unit, respond to all 9
    key-term flashcards linked above.  Click on “Instructions” in the
    shaded bar below the flashcard, and follow the directions and
    options described.  If at any point in reviewing the flashcards you
    are unsure of the answer, refer to the course textbook, Lucas’
    textbook’s summary or outline pages, and/or perform an Internet
    search to uncover the answer.  Be aware that if you discover the
    terms used deviate significantly from the textbook readings or the
    lecture, you can click on “Key Terms” in the shaded bar to see the
    complete list of terms and definitions for the set of flashcards. 
    After you have reviewed that list, click on “Start Over” to re-test
    yourself. Keep in mind that you can choose to a.) see the term and
    provide the definition or b.) see the definition and provide the
    term by toggling the box to the left of the phrase “key term first,”
    located on the right-hand side of the pink shaded bar.  To check the
    accuracy of your answers, click on the word “flip” in the lower
    right-hand corner of the flashcard.  This action will turn the card
    over and prompt the system to announce the correct term.  If your
    response was incorrect, click on flashcard box labeled “study
    again.”  This will save the term for you to return to later and then
    turn over a new flashcard.  Once you have completed all of the
    flashcards in the set, if you got any of them incorrect, consider
    reviewing the chapter summary, the reading assignments, and/or the
    lecture again before you click on any of the unshaded boxes in the
    row at the bottom of the flashcard.  The unshaded boxes represent

     Instructions: After you have completed the preceding flashcard
    assignment, respond to all 19 questions in this self-scoring study
    question quiz, including the last 3 open-ended questions. You should
    plan to spend about 1 minute on each question.  When you have
    finished, click on the “submit answers” button in the lower
    right-hand corner of your screen and review how you performed on the
    quiz.  Notice as you do so that any questions you answered
    incorrectly will include a green check mark identifying the correct
    answer, as well as an explanation for that answer presented in
    bold-faced type.  You can also check your answers to the open-ended
    questions at the end of the quiz by comparing them to the bold-faced
    text which will appear in the answer field.  (Note, however, that
    only the multiple-choice questions are used to calculate your actual
    quiz score.)
