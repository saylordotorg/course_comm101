**Unit 15: Persuasive Speaking** <span id="15"></span> 
*Most speakers consider persuasive speaking as the most difficult of the
three basic types (informative, persuasive, and entertaining).  One of
the reasons why understanding the demands of persuasive speaking is more
difficult is because it requires a knowledge of terms that are specific
to argumentation, such as claims and evidence.  What is important to
realize, however, is that while the terms may be different, most of the
elements they refer to function in ways that are similar to what occurs
in informative and entertaining speeches.  Main points are called
arguments, supporting detail is evidence, but presenting your
observation and then backing them up with the kind of information your
audience can understand, accept, and/or appreciate is universal
communicative behavior. *

**Unit 15 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 9.5 hours to complete.

**15.1.3 Theories of Persuasion** <span id="15.1.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit
15.1.  For this subunit, you should pay attention to the distinguishing
elements of the social judgment and cognitive dissonance theories, as
well as the five traits associated with the elaboration likelihood
model: personal relevance and involvement, accountability, personal
responsibility, incongruent information, and the need for cognition.
 These subtopics are introduced by subheadings in the “Section 17.1:
Persuasion: An Overview” reading.*            

**15.2 Types of Persuasive Speeches** <span id="15.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: Stand up, Speak out - The Practice and Ethics of Public
    Speaking: “Chapter 17, Section 17.2: Types of Persuasive Speeches”**
    Link: *Stand up, Speak out - The Practice and Ethics of Public
    Speaking:* [“Chapter 17, Section 17.2: Types of Persuasive
    Speeches”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Stand%20Up,%20Speak%20Out%20-%20The%20Practice%20and%20Ethics%20of%20Public%20Speaking.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please read all of Section 17.2, which discusses
    claims.  Most people use the term “argument” instead of “claim,” but
    there are subtle distinctions between those two terms.  The textbook
    emphasizes that a claim is a declaration about attitudes, values,
    beliefs, or behaviors.  Another way to view a claim, however, is in
    relation to an argument, which some define as “a series of
    statements used to persuade someone of something,” which is how the
    supplemental reading provided next in this unit approaches the
    term.  From this perspective, a claim is the conclusion you want
    your audience to arrive at after you have presented your arguments
    and the evidence that supports them. Thus, returning to the parlance
    of the course textbook, in persuasive speaking, you establish your
    claim in your thesis statement, while you establish that claim via
    the main points of your speech: the arguments.  Attempt the
    exercises provided at the end of the reading.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please read all of Section 17.3, which covers the
    three most commonly used organizing patterns in argumentation. 
    There are also two other patterns that should be aware of, although
    there is no consistent terminology to refer to them.  These
    alternative patterns focus on dealing with opposing arguments and
    are less audience-oriented than the ones presented in your
    textbook.  The “trial lawyer” model uses a point-counterpoint
    pattern to refute each opposing claim and is used when the number of
    arguments for and against is balanced.  The “refute and overwhelm”
    model is used when one side has more arguments for it than against
    it.  This model starts with a balanced refutation of opposing claims
    and then moves on to “overwhelm” the opposition by presenting
    additional, irrefutable arguments.  Attempt the exercises at the end
    of the reading to reinforce concepts learned in this subunit.

    (Adobe Flash)  
        
     Instructions: After you have completed all of the readings,
    lectures, and other resources for this unit, respond to all 23
    key-term flashcards linked above.  Click on “Instructions” in the
    shaded bar below the flashcard and follow the directions and options
    described.  If at any point in reviewing the flashcards you are
    unsure of the answer, refer to the course textbook, Lucas’
    textbook’s summary or outline pages, and/or perform an Internet
    search to uncover the answer.  Be aware that if you discover the
    terms used deviate significantly from the textbook readings or the
    lecture, you can click on “Key Terms” in the shaded bar to see the
    complete list of terms and definitions for the set of flashcards.
     After you have reviewed that list, click on “Start Over” to re-test
    yourself.  Keep in mind that you can choose to a.) see the term and
    provide the definition or b.) see the definition and provide the
    term by toggling the box to the left of the phrase “key term first,”
    located on the right-hand side of the pink shaded bar.  To check the
    accuracy of your answers, click on the word “flip” in the lower
    right-hand corner of the flashcard.  This action will turn the card
    over and prompt the system to announce the correct term.  If your
    response was incorrect, click on flashcard box labeled “study
    again.”  This will save the term for you to return to later and then
    turn over a new flashcard.  Once you have completed all of the
    flashcards in the set, if you got any of them incorrect, consider
    reviewing the chapter summary, the reading assignments, and/or the
    lecture again before you click on any of the unshaded boxes in the
    row at the bottom of the flashcard.  The unshaded boxes represent
    key terms you did not identify correctly in your previous attempt
    and give you the opportunity to reinforce your learning experience
    by revisiting those terms.
