Course Syllabus for "COMM101: Public Speaking"
----------------------------------------------

The purpose of this course is to systematically examine the elements and
factors which result in an effective speech.  The textbook and
associated lectures present an element-by-element examination of the
essentials of public speaking while also identifying traits of the
individual speaker and how they impact preparation and presentation.  In
addition to these resources, a comprehensive series of brief videos
demonstrate specific, performance-oriented aspects of public speaking. 
Tying each of these course elements together are the themes of
information and ethics, emphasized in each resource because they are
becoming increasingly important to all communicators.  For example, the
textbook constantly returns to the discussion of society’s
ever-increasing access to information and the demands on the individual
to use it effectively and ethically.  The authors note that “the *New
York Times* has more information in one week than individuals in the
1800s would encounter in a lifetime,” which illustrates the challenges
speakers face beyond the ready-made burden of coping with the inevitable
anxieties of speaking to the public.  In spite of that environment,
ethical communication means not only accepting responsibility for the
information one presents, but also speaking up when others abuse their
information platforms. You should be aware that the textbook, [*Stand
up, Speak out - The Practice and Ethics of Public
Speaking*](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Stand-Up-Speak-Out-The-Practice-and-Ethics-of-Public-Speaking.pdf)*,*
drives the content of each unit and thus will help you anticipate,
absorb, and integrate the information more efficiently than the
lectures.  The most distinguishing trait of the textbook is the way it
breaks topics down into categories and subcategories. You should notice
immediately how this is presented in this first unit of the course,
paying particular attention to the most frequently used word which
signals such categorization, “type,” because knowing the “types” a
subject can be classified into is equivalent to learning the options a
speaker has when strategizing about what content or technique will be
effective.  Lastly, you should be aware that you will have the
opportunity to use the abbreviated contents from a second textbook in
conjunction with many of the video lectures.  Although those lectures
closely follow the 10<sup>th</sup> edition of Stephen Lucas’ [*The Art
of Public
Speakin*g](http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/007256296x/sitemap.html),
the online resources that you can access are from its 8<sup>th</sup>
edition; nevertheless, you will still find that the chapter outlines,
summary, and crossword puzzles in the older text are relevant and
helpful tools for listening and responding to the lectures.

### Course Information

Welcome to COMM101: Public Speaking.  Below, please find general
information on this course and its requirements.

**Course Designer:** [P. Wynn
Norman](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-h-n/#ProfessorPWynnNorman)

**Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following resource:

-   <span dir="LTR">[*Stand up, Speak out - The Practice and Ethics of
    Public
    Speaking*](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Stand-Up-Speak-Out-The-Practice-and-Ethics-of-Public-Speaking.pdf)
    (HTML)</span>

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Pay special attention to Unit 1 as this lays the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in the
later units.  You will also need to complete: 

-   <span dir="LTR">Unit 1 Assignment</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">Unit 2 Assignment</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">Unit 3 Assignment</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">Unit 4 Assignment</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">Unit 5 Assignment</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">Unit 6 Assignment</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">Unit 7 Assignment</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">Unit 8 Assignment</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">Unit 9 Assignment</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">Unit 10 Assignment</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">Unit 11 Assignment</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">Unit 12 Assignment</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">Unit 13 Assignment</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">Unit 14 Assignment</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">Unit 15 Assignment</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">The Final Exam</span>

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the materials in each unit.

In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **92 hours**
to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the amount
of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These should help
you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and to determine how much time you have over the
next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and
decide to complete subunits 1.1 and 1.2 (approximately 2.5 hours) on
Monday night; subunit 1.3 (approximately 3.5 hours) on Tuesday night;
etc.

**Tips/Suggestions:** To gain maximum benefit from the resources in this
course, it is recommended that you review the reading assignments and
then listen to the lectures, most of which are closely aligned with the
readings.  As you read, take careful notes on a separate sheet of
paper.  Mark down any important information and advice on effective
communication that stand out to you.  These notes will be useful to use
for review as you study for your Final Exam.
