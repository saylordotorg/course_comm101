**Unit 13: Presentation Aids: Design and Usage** <span id="13"></span> 
*Decisions and opportunities associated with the design and use of
presentation aids are innumerable, making it difficult to decide where
to begin, but not if you approach such aids systematically.  Many
students err in this area when they develop the entire contents of their
speeches first and then go back and attempt to fit some aids into the
presentation —or even more commonly, simply used such aids to summarize
content.  Developing aids in such an isolated way almost always results
in materials which do not strengthen a presentation, and sometimes even
weaken it considerably.  Systematically approaching the development of
presentation aids means you select identify what you will require “as
you go.”  For example, you have been advised in this course to develop
the body section of your speech first.  That section is controlled by
main points and fleshed out by supporting details and evidence.  As you
identify the contents for each of these elements, you should ask
yourself whether they would be enhanced—made more powerful, clearer,
more memorable, or just more understandable—if aided.  In other words,
you should have a reason for including every presentation aid you use.*

**Unit 13 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 8 hours to complete.

**Unit13 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:  
  
-   Watch a speech and critique the design, use, and handling of the
    presentation aids it contains.
-   Identify two ways in which presentation aids can increase the
    audience’s understanding of a message.
-   Choose the most appropriate type of presentation aid to support the
    main points in a sample speech.
-   Compare the advantages and disadvantages of different presentation
    aid media.
-   Critique the organization, simplicity, and visual and/or verbal
    clarity of presentation aids in a speech.

     Instructions: Please read both the Chapter 15 introduction and
    Section 15.1 in their entirety, paying particular attention to the
    functions of presentation aids.  As with so much about public
    speaking, it is important to understand why you are developing
    elements like presentation aids since, if you develop them simply
    because you think you have to, inevitably their effectiveness will
    be reduced.  Try to complete the exercises at the end of the reading
    to reinforce your understanding of concepts learned in this
    subunit.

**13.1.1 Improving Audience Understanding** <span id="13.1.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 13.1
and is introduced by a subheading in the “Section 15.1: Functions of
Presentation Aids” reading.  It is important that you absorb from this
subunit that there are two ways effective visual aids influence audience
understanding: by clarifying information and by emphasizing
information.  Ideally, your visuals should be intentionally designed to
accomplish one or both of these goals. *

**13.1.3 Aiding Retention and Recall** <span id="13.1.3"></span> 

*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 13.1
and is introduced by a subheading in the “Section 15.1: Functions of
Presentation Aids” reading.*

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please read Section 15.2 in its entirety, and
    consider committing to memory the list of presentation aid types it
    describes.  If your career points to frequent public speaking,
    knowing the range of aids that are available will help you make the
    most effective choices for your presentations, rather than just the
    most familiar ones.  As has been noted throughout this course, the
    textbook tends to present information in lists.  Some of those
    lists, like the list of presentation aid types in this section,
    contain information you want to become more than familiar with; some
    lists should be committed to memory, because they will expand your
    awareness of the options that are available.  Try to complete the
    questions in the Exercises section at the end of the reading to
    assess the use of presentation aids.

     Instructions: Please read Section 15.3 in its entirety, paying
    particular attention to the resources described in Table 15.1, which
    include several free, online presentation software packages that can
    be used immediately and incorporated into webpages, saved online, or
    downloaded for offline use.  Several of these resources are
    comparable to the Microsoft Office’s PowerPoint application; 280
    Slides, for example, is particularly useful for presentations which
    use embedded videos, because it includes instant web searches that
    can be inserted on slides in one, simple step.  Complete the
    exercises at the end of the reading.

**13.3.1 Computer-Based Media** <span id="13.3.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 13.3
and is introduced by a subheading in the “Section 15.3: Media to Use for
Presentation Aids” reading.  For a broader understanding of what
computer-based visual aids creation and presentation tools are
available, consider exploring the links in Table 15.1.  Such software
packages typically include on their homepages a summary or a link to a
summary of what the software is capable of doing.  It is those
capacities which will be instructive, because they represent
opportunities that you can consider when designing your materials.  The
challenge for many people who must create something from nothing is that
if they do not know what options are available, what they create is
limited to only what they know.  By reviewing software, you can become
more informed of your options.*

**13.3.2 Audiovisual Media** <span id="13.3.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 13.3
and is introduced by a subheading in “Section 15.3: Media to Use for
Presentation Aids” Section 3 reading.  It covers four types of low-tech
visual aid media: chalk or dry-erase board, flipcharts, poster board or
foam board, and handouts.*

**13.3.3 Low-Tech Media** <span id="13.3.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 13.3

     Instructions: Please read all of Section 15.4, which provides good
    advice on how to design your aids to be accessible to your audience,
    easily manipulated, and aesthetically pleasing.  Pay particular
    attention to the tips about creating the aids, covered in Section 3.
    Note, however, that since this is a visual subject, seeing examples
    of good and bad presentation aids is even more valuable than just
    reading about them.  Because of this, this reading material has been
    supplemented by a detailed lecture on the subject, which provides an
    in-depth discussion about and more extensive examples of
    well-designed and poorly designed aids.  Try to complete the
    exercises at the end of the reading.

     Instructions: After you have completed all of the readings,
    lectures, and other resources for this unit, respond to all 9
    key-term flashcards linked above.  Click on “Instructions” in the
    shaded bar below the flashcard and follow the directions and options
    described.  If at any point in reviewing the flashcards you are
    unsure of the answer, refer to the course textbook, Lucas’
    textbook’s summary or outline pages, and/or perform an Internet
    search to uncover the answer.  Be aware that if you discover the
    terms used deviate significantly from the textbook readings or the
    lecture, you can click on “Key Terms” in the shaded bar to see the
    complete list of terms and definitions for the set of flashcards. 
    After you have reviewed that list, click on “Start Over” to re-test
    yourself.  Keep in mind that you can choose to a.) see the term and
    provide the definition or b.) see the definition and provide the
    term by toggling the box to the left of the phrase “key term first,”
    located on the right-hand side of the pink shaded bar.  To check the
    accuracy of your answers, click on the word “flip” in the lower
    right-hand corner of the flashcard.  This action will turn the card
    over and prompt the system to announce the correct term.  If your
    response was incorrect, click on flashcard box labeled “study
    again.”  This will save the term for you to return to later and then
    turn over a new flashcard.  Once you have completed all of the
    flashcards in the set, if you got any of them incorrect, consider
    reviewing the chapter summary, the reading assignments, and/or the
    lecture again before you click on any of the unshaded boxes in the
    row at the bottom of the flashcard.  The unshaded boxes represent
    key terms you did not identify correctly in your previous attempt
    and give you the opportunity to reinforce your learning experience
    by revisiting those terms.
