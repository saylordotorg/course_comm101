**Unit 4: Audience Analysis** <span id="4"></span> 
**The Shannon and Weaver model of communication introduced in Unit 1
(see the Section 1.2 reading in* Stand up, Speak out: The Practice and
Ethics of Public Speaking) *identifies all of the elements which
influence the process of communication, and because it is a model
intended to apply to a wide range of communication situations, it uses
generic terms for those elements: “source,” not “speaker;” “receiver,”
not “audience;” “noise,” not “distraction,” for example.  Considering
your “audience” in the generic sense of being “receivers” of your
messages is a good way to approach the contents of this unit.  The word
“audience” tends to imply the passivity of sitting before a television
or a stage or a book, as spectators not participants.  However, in
reality audiences are far more active than that, and using Shannon and
Weaver’s generic terms, you can frame this concept of the audience as a
receiver more clearly.  A source sends a message to a receiver in the
same way a pitcher tosses a ball to a batter.  The pitcher analyzes,
among other things, the batter’s stance and perhaps what is known about
the batter’s swinging style, temperament, or weaknesses.  Then, the
pitcher throws the ball and the batter reacts either by swinging,
because the throw was good, or by stepping back because the ball was
foul.  Communication audiences react much like batters; their responses
are based on how the ball—the message—is sent to them.  The analogy
breaks down at this point, however, because in the game of baseball, the
pitcher does not want the batter to connect with the ball, while in
public speaking, that connection is your goal.  As you review the
materials in this unit, keep in mind that audiences are not passive. 
They stand at bat, ready to swing and hit, swing and miss, or stand back
and let your message just pass them by.   **

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 7.5 hours to complete.

**4.1 Why Conduct an Audience Analysis?** <span id="4.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Stand up, Speak out: The Practice and Ethics of Public
    Speaking: “Chapter 5, Section 5.1: Why Conduct an Audience
    Analysis?”**
    Link: *Stand up, Speak out: The Practice and Ethics of Public
    Speaking:* [“Chapter 5, Section 5.1: Why Conduct an Audience
    Analysis?”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Stand%20Up,%20Speak%20Out%20-%20The%20Practice%20and%20Ethics%20of%20Public%20Speaking.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please read the introduction to Chapter 5 and Section
    5.1, which explains why audience analysis is often considered the
    most important step in preparing to speak.  In fact, the success of
    a speech depends on how well a speaker anticipates the nature and
    needs of his or her audience.  As a result, audience analysis is
    often what distinguishes the planned effectiveness of professional
    speakers from the uncertainty that students and other amateurs
    experience when they do not put enough effort into analyzing their
    audiences.  Attempt to answer the questions in the Exercises section
    at the end of the reading.

**4.1.1 Defining Audience Analysis** <span id="4.1.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 4.1. 
To cover this topic, focus on the relationship between the terms
“audience-centered” and “audience analysis” to understand how that
relationship explains why effective speakers present speeches “for” an
audience, rather than “to” an audience, and thus create content that has
a more lasting impact.  This information is introduced by a subheading
in the “Section 5.1: Why Conduct an Audience Analysis” reading.*

**4.1.2 Reasons for Audience Analysis** <span id="4.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 4.1. 
Conducting an audience analysis is a complicated task, which is why the
textbook divides that task into four areas, each of which you should pay
particular attention to because without them, your audience analysis may
prove to be insufficient. Although not ordered into steps, you can
approach these areas sequentially, starting with acknowledging the
audience, then choosing a worthwhile topic given that audience, adapting
that topic to the audience’s specific needs, and lastly developing ethos
to insure that your audience cares about the topic you have chosen.
 Each of these areas is introduced by a subheading in the “Section 5.1:
Why Conduct an Audience Analysis” reading.*

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please read Section 5.2 in its entirety, and realize
    that special importance that the textbook’s topic breakdown has with
    respect to this particular topic.  Although it may seem like a
    repetitious technique, it is also a way to examine all angles of a
    topic. Audience analysis illustrates this well, because failing to
    account for one factor can result in erroneous conclusions about
    others.  Psychographic and situational factors, for example, are
    more difficult to measure; yet they can render readily available
    demographics useless for planning purposes.  Attempt the questions
    in the Exercises section at the end of the reading; it may help to
    work with a friend or family member to address question 4.

**4.2.1 Demographic Audience Analysis** <span id="4.2.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 4.2. 
The most commonly used breakdown of demographic audience information
includes age, gender, culture, religion, group membership, education,
and occupation. Moreover, of all the topic breakdowns covered in this
course, this is one that any good speaker should be able to recite
without notes, because they are such an important part of speech
planning.  As a result, spend time committing them to memory.  To absorb
those other ways more effectively, also pay attention to how they are
covered in the web media resources in this subunit, Tracy Goodwin’s
“Public Speaking Tips” video series.  Each of these topics is introduced
in the textbook under a heading in the “Section 5.2: Three Types of
Audience Analysis” reading.*

**4.2.2 Psychological Audience Analysis** <span id="4.2.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 4.2. 
Psychological audience analysis will help you to identify preexisting
notions held by an audience which fall into two categories: notions
about your topic and notions about you.  While both can be difficult to
assess accurately, you should recognize that the technique for
addressing them is simply a matter of providing your audience with
information about yourself and your topic, actions which are usually
initiated in the introduction section of your speech.  Keep this in mind
when you encounter the material in this course that covers how to
develop your speech introduction.  These topics are introduced in the
textbook under headings in the “Section 5.2: Three Types of Audience
Analysis” reading.*

**4.2.3 Situational Audience Analysis** <span id="4.2.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 4.2. 
Many of the audience characteristics that audience analysis identifies
require you to adjust your speech; however, many situational traits, if
they are addressed early enough in the speech preparation process, can
actually be dealt with by adjusting you audience.  Whether the person is
you or your speech organizer, someone controls the situation in which
your speech will take place and therefore someone has the ability to
influence the size of your audience, the occasion in which it takes
place, whether the audience is listening voluntarily or involuntarily,
and characteristics of the speech’s physical setting.  These topics are
introduced in the textbook under headings in the “Section 5.2: Three
Types of Audience Analysis” reading.*

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please read Section 5.3 in its entirety, which
    introduces some tools for conducting audience analyses.  As you read
    this material, keep in mind the difference between tools and
    techniques.  Techniques are proven, systematic procedures or actions
    that are used to complete a task or accomplish an objective; tools
    are used to perform those procedures or actions.  Audience analysis
    is one of several techniques that are required to prepare an
    effective speech.  The tools used to perform an audience analysis
    include observations, interviews, surveys, focus groups, and
    existing data.  Attempt the questions in the Exercises section at
    the end of the reading; it may help to work with a friend or family
    member to address any questions that require partners.

**4.3.1 Direct Observation** <span id="4.3.1"></span> 
*Note:* *This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit
4.3. * *For this subunit, you should focus on how you can use direction
observation as a tool for gathering information about an audience. 
Evaluate the recommendations in the textbook which you can or cannot
accommodate and focus on the ones that are doable. * *This material is
introduced by a heading in the “Section 5.3: Conducting Audience
Analysis” reading.*

**4.3.2 Interviews and Surveys** <span id="4.3.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 4.3.*
* For this subunit, you should focus on whether and when you can use
interviews and surveys as a tool for gathering information about your
audience.  Evaluate the recommendations in the textbook which you can or
cannot accommodate and focus on the ones that are doable.  This material
is introduced by a heading in the “Section 5.3: Conducting Audience
Analysis” reading.*

**4.3.3 Focus Groups** <span id="4.3.3"></span> 
*Note:* *This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit
4.3. * *For this subunit, you should focus on the general nature of
focus groups that can be translated in your specific circumstances since
the validity and thus the usefulness of this tool is heavily reliant on
how appropriately the focus groups are created. Most individual speakers
do not have the skill or resources to set up focus groups effectively. 
This material is introduced by a heading in the “Section 5.3: Conducting
Audience Analysis” reading.*

**4.3.4 Using Existing Data About Your Audience** <span
id="4.3.4"></span> 
*Note:* *This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit
4.3. * *Unlike the previous subunit, existing data is an audience
analysis tool which most speakers can access and utilize.  As a result,
focus on where you can obtain the data as you review this material,

    audience analysis is used to prepare a speech, but you should not
    neglect opportunities to improve your speech by noticing the
    feedback audiences can provide while you are speaking.  This is
    another area which you are encouraged to consider carefully and
    apply to the scenarios you may encounter in assignments.  Attempt to
    answer the questions in the Exercises section at the end of the
    reading.

**4.4.1 Prepare Content With Your Audience In Mind** <span
id="4.4.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 4.4. 
It is hard to absorb information about audience analysis without using
it, which is why you should read the material in this subunit with the
intent of applying it to the assignments at the end of this unit, which
tie together the many details involving audience analysis that have been
covered.  Moreover, realize that because understanding audiences and
using that understanding to improve the effectiveness of your speech is
so important, you will be revisiting this subject in the next unit too. 
This material is introduced by a heading in the “Section 5.4: Using Your
Audience Analysis” reading.*

**4.4.2 Adjusting Your Speech Based On Your Analysis** <span
id="4.4.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 4.4. 
You may think that the textbook could have dealt with this topic and the
preceding one at the same time.  However, recognize that this subunit
focuses on adjustments that you should make during your presentation,
while the preceding material concerns actions you can take before the
speech.  This topic is introduced by a heading in the “Section 5.4:
