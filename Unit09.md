**Unit 9: Introductions and Conclusions** <span id="9"></span> 
*Now that you have an understanding of how to develop the body of your
speech, it is time to focus on creating an engaging introduction and
memorable conclusion.  This unit will provide information on the
functions of an introduction and conclusion, as well as it will provide
tips on developing effective openings and closings to your speech.  You
will also review analysis of introductions and conclusions in this unit
to use as models in understanding which techniques work best in
developing strong introductions and conclusions.  As you review the
resources in this unit, keep in mind that terminology used in
instruction can vary from source to source.  Moreover, some sources will
group together information which others keep separate.  These two traits
are often the case with resources which discuss the functions of speech
introductions and conclusions.  When you encounter differences in the
resources in this section, consider focusing on that resource which
breaks down the information the most.  Such a breakdown can be used as a
checklist of what you must accomplish to be effective when you present
these sections of your speech. This is particularly important with
introductions and conclusions since different sources identify between
three and five functions which these sections must fulfill. As a result,
you should favor that source which identifies the most functions,
thereby insuring that your introduction and conclusion sections are as
effective as possible.*

**Unit 9 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 5.25 hours to complete.

**9.1 Functions of the Introduction** <span id="9.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Stand up, Speak out: The Practice and Ethics of Public
    Speaking: “Chapter 9, Section 9.1: The Importance of an
    Introduction”**
     Link: *Stand up, Speak out: The Practice and Ethics of Public
    Speaking:* [“Chapter 9, Section 9.1: The Importance of an
    Introduction”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Stand%20Up,%20Speak%20Out%20-%20The%20Practice%20and%20Ethics%20of%20Public%20Speaking.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please read both the Chapter 9 introduction and
    Section 9.1 in their entirety.  These readings describe five
    functions your introduction must accomplish in order to prepare your
    audience for the important information you present in the body of
    your speech.  Understanding the logic behind these tasks will enable
    you to realize why they are essential, not optional.  For example,
    you must start your speech with an attention-getter, because if your
    audience is not paying attention to your words, much of what you
    subsequently state may not be heard or understood.  Similarly, your
    audience must understand why you are addressing them, what you hope
    to accomplish by doing so, and why you are someone worthy of your
    audience’s attention.  Lastly, because you have an audience of
    listeners, you will work throughout your speech, starting with your
    introduction, to make sure they are anticipating the information you
    present.  Listeners’ comprehension increases when they know what
    information to expect.  Note also that this subunit provides an
    overview of the subject.  The textbook goes into more details about
    these points in Section 3 of Chapter 9.  Attempt the exercises at
    the end of the reading.  Note that this reading covers the topics in
    subunits 9.1.1 through 9.1.5.

     Instructions: Please read all of Section 9.2, which presents more
    lists.  Lists appear frequently in this textbook, but you should
    appreciate rather than be annoyed by them. Public speaking is a
    function that has existed for a very long time.  As a result, many
    experienced and knowledgeable individuals have contributed to a very
    comprehensive knowledge bank on the subject, a bank which is an
    efficient source of ready-made ideas and techniques.  The lists in
    the textbook should be treated as resources for you to draw from
    rather than struggling to produce ideas or techniques that have
    already been identified.  Try to answer the questions in the
    Exercises section at the end of the reading to consider and identify
    attention-grabbing techniques.  This reading covers the topics in
    subunits 9.2.1 and 9.2.2.

id="9.2.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 9.2. 
It identifies four issues which you should take into account when you
are deciding what kind of attention-getter to use: the appropriateness
or relevance of the attention-getting device to the audience’s
background, the purpose of your speech, the topic of your speech and the
occasion for which you are speaking. These issues are each introduced in
a subheading in the “Section 9.2: The Attention Getter” reading.*

It identifies ten ways you can attract an audience’s attention:
referring to the speech’s subject, audience, current events, the
speaker’s personal experience, history, or the occasion are six common
methods.  The other four involve using an anecdote, startling
statements, a question, or humor.  Each method is introduced in a
subheading in the “Section 9.2: The Attention Getter” reading.*

    Section 11.1, which include a very important reminder of how
    inexperienced speakers frequently leave their audiences unimpressed,
    because the speaker has put little effort into developing his or her
    conclusion.  Pay attention to the three primary functions of a
    conclusion: to restate the thesis, review the main points, and use a
    memorable closing device.  Also note, however, that your textbook
    fails to mention two other important functions that should be
    fulfilled in a conclusion: 1.) signal to your audience that the
    speech is about to end and 2.) remind your audience of the
    significance of the topic or their relationship to it.  It may help
    to try to answer the questions in the Exercises section to reinforce
    your understanding of concepts learned in this subunit.

**9.6 Steps In Developing a Conclusion** <span id="9.6"></span>

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please read all of Section 11.2, which discusses
    functions similar to those found in the introduction, except in
    almost-reverse order.  Now that you have read about the functions
    and content of the three parts of a speech—introduction, body, and
    conclusion—note how each part repeats information from previous
    parts.  Effective communicators use repetition to ensure that their
    message is absorbed accurately by their audiences.  Repetition as an
    effective technique is sometimes referred to as following the
    Tell’em<sup>3</sup> Principle (pronounced “Tell ‘em cubed”) in which
    you tell your audience what you are going to tell them (by inserting
    near the end of your introduction a preview of the main points your
    speech will cover), then you tell them (by presenting your main
    points in the body of your speech), and then you tell them what you
    told them (by reviewing at the beginning of your conclusion the main
    points the body).  The Tell’em<sup>3</sup> Principle is particularly
    important to use with listeners, because they cannot go back and
    re-read to enable them to remember what you stated.  This reading
    covers the topics in subunits 9.6.1 through 9.6.3.

     Instructions: Please watch this 2-minute video, which demonstrates
    two functions of a conclusion which have not received enough
    attention in this unit: 1.) signaling to your audience that the
    speech is about to end and 2.) reminding your audience of the
    significance of the topic or their relationship to it.  Pay
    particular attention to how this speaker uses the second task to not
    only review the speech’s main points but also make its conclusion
    more memorable.

**Unit 9 Assignment and Assessment** <span id="9.8"></span> 
-   **Assignment: McGraw-Hill Higher Education: Steven E. Lucas’ *The
    Art of Public Speaking*: “Chapter 9 – Key-Term Flashcards”**
    Link: McGraw-Hill Higher Education: Steven E. Lucas’ *The Art of
    Public Speaking*: [“Chapter 9 – Key-Term
    Flashcards”](http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/007313564x/student_view0/chapter9/key-term_flashcards.html)
    (Adobe Flash)  
        
     Instructions: After you have completed all of the readings,
    lectures, and other resources for this unit, respond to all 7
    key-term flashcards linked above.  Click on “Instructions” in the
    shaded bar below the flashcard, and follow the directions and
    options described.  If at any point in reviewing the flashcards you
    are unsure of the answer, refer to the course textbook, Lucas’
    textbook’s summary or outline pages, and/or perform an internet
    search to uncover the answer.  Be aware that if you discover the
    terms used deviate significantly from the textbook readings or the
    lecture, you can click on “Key Terms” in the shaded bar to see the
    complete list of terms and definitions for the set of flashcards.
    After you have reviewed that list, click on “Start Over” to re-test
    yourself.  Keep in mind that you can choose to a.) see the term and
    provide the definition or b.) see the definition and provide the
    term by toggling the box to the left of the phrase “key term first,”
    located on the right-hand side of the pink shaded bar.  To check the
    accuracy of your answers, click on the word “flip” in the lower
    right-hand corner of the flashcard.  This action will turn the card
    over and prompt the system to announce the correct term.  If your
    response was incorrect, click on flashcard box labeled “study
    again.”  This will save the term for you to return to later and then
    turn over a new flashcard.  Once you have completed all of the
    flashcards in the set, if you got any of them incorrect, consider
    reviewing the chapter summary, the reading assignments, and/or the
    lecture again before you click on any of the unshaded boxes in the
    row at the bottom of the flashcard.  The unshaded boxes represent
    key terms you did not identify correctly in your previous attempt
    and give you the opportunity to reinforce your learning experience
    by revisiting those terms.
