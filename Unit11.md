**Unit 11: The Importance of Language** <span id="11"></span> 
*Critiquing the language you use in a speech is the oral equivalent of
editing your own writing.  It can be difficult to recognize when words
and phrases you use casually every day may not suit the context or
audience of a public presentation.  Upon completing the readings and
viewing the web media in this unit, you may conclude that it contains
too many minor details about this subject.  However, that would be an
inappropriate conclusion. You may not remember all of those details,
your exposure to them will, at the very least, heighten your awareness
of the importance of choosing language which suits the occasion, even
if, as is often the case, it does not suit you as well.  Indeed,
attention to language is often what distinguishes the professional
communicator from the casual one, and it is why the term “wordsmith” is
sometimes used as a compliment to those who do it well.*

**Unit11 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:  
  
-   Recognize the differences between denotative and connotative
    definitions.
-   Match a misunderstanding in communication to the denotative or
    connotative issue that produced it.
-   Contrast the traits of oral and written language.
-   Choose the more effective examples of appropriate and vivid language
    in a given context.
-   Revise a statement such that it exhibits more inclusive language.
-   Revise a statement such that it exhibits language which a given
    audience would be more familiar with.
-   Identify each of the six elements of language in a sample speech.

**11.1 Oral vs. Written Language** <span id="11.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Stand up, Speak out: The Practice and Ethics of Public
    Speaking: “Chapter 13, Section 13.1: Oral versus Written Language”**
    Link: *Stand up, Speak out: The Practice and Ethics of Public
    Speaking:* [“Chapter 13, Section 13.1: Oral versus Written
    Language”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Stand%20Up,%20Speak%20Out%20-%20The%20Practice%20and%20Ethics%20of%20Public%20Speaking.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please read the Chapter 13 introduction and Section
    13.1 carefully, because these readings cover the most distinguishing
    traits of speaking in contrast to writing.  Such traits can be
    difficult for speakers to adopt, especially if they are anxious
    about public speaking; however, the same traits are some of the most
    influential cues noticed by audiences.  As you absorb these issues,
    keep in mind two aspects of communication, precision, and
    effectiveness, and also consider that logic behind the use of oral
    verses written communication is often one of precision over
    effectiveness.  Be prepared to discuss why this is the case and to
    recognize where in a speech effectiveness over precision is evident.
     Attempt the exercises at the end of the reading to reinforce the
    importance of choosing appropriate language and diction (word
    choice).

     Instructions: Please read Section 13.2 in its entirety for an
    overview of those elements of speaking which engage listeners,
    regardless of whether the context is public speaking or personal
    speaking.  As you consider the points made in this reading, contrast
    the communication experiences you have had which you found that by
    the time the experience ended you had lost track of how much time
    had passed, because you found so intolerable that you stopped
    listening entirely.  Whether you are conversing one-on-one,
    listening to a radio talk show, watching a movie, or sitting in on a
    speech, the qualities of communication which engage or fail to
    engage you are the same.  Try to answer the questions in the
    Exercises section at the end of the reading to reinforce what you
    have learned in this subunit.

*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 11.2
and is introduced by a subheading in the “Section 13.2: Using Language

major determinants of speech content: the speaker, the audience, the
topic, and the context, it leaves out many important issues concerning
this subject in the broader context of communication.  This is why an
additional reading assignment has been included below.*

    complete list of terms and definitions for the set of flashcards. 
    After you have reviewed that list, click on “Start Over” to re-test
    yourself.  Keep in mind that you can choose to a.) see the term and
    provide the definition or b.) see the definition and provide the
    term by toggling the box to the left of the phrase “key term first,”
    located on the right-hand side of the pink shaded bar.  To check the
    accuracy of your answers, click on the word “flip” in the lower
    right-hand corner of the flashcard.  This action will turn the card
    over and prompt the system to announce the correct term.  If your
    response was incorrect, click on flashcard box labeled “study
    again.”  This will save the term for you to return to later and then
    turn over a new flashcard.  Once you have completed all of the
    flashcards in the set, if you got any of them incorrect, consider
    reviewing the chapter summary, the reading assignments, and/or the
    lecture again before you click on any of the unshaded boxes in the
    row at the bottom of the flashcard.  The unshaded boxes represent
    key terms you did not identify correctly in your previous attempt
    and give you the opportunity to reinforce your learning experience
    by revisiting those terms.
