**Unit 8: The Body of a Speech** <span id="8"></span> 
*This unit of the course deviates from the order of content presented in
the textbook by presenting material on developing the body of your
speech before material on developing the speech’s introduction.  This
has been done because an introduction introduces the body of the speech,
but if the body of the speech does not exist yet, the speaker has
nothing to base the introduction on.  This unit also begins the second
half of the course, which focuses on actually developing a speech. 
Moreover, because public speaking requires performance as well as
comprehension, starting with this unit, the rest of this course includes
a number of assignments which challenge you to apply the information you
obtain to specific tasks associated with writing or presenting a
speech.*

**Unit 8 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 5.5 hours to complete.

**Unit8 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:  
  
-   Match main points to the specific purposes you would support.
-   Based on a given specific purpose, narrow a speech by choosing from
    a set of possible points the most effective set of main points.
-   Identify which organizational pattern is being used in a given
    passage from a speech.
-   Based on the topic and specific purpose of a speech, identify the
    most appropriate organizational pattern combination of patterns.
-   Insert effective transitions and signposts to improve the coherence
    and clarity of a speech’s transcript or sentence outline.
-   From a list of transitional devices, choose a set which would create
    both variety and consistency.
-   Identify locations in a speech where internal previews, internal
    summaries, or signposts should be placed.
-   Point out the major elements (main points, supporting detail,
    transitions, signposts) used in the body of a sample speech.

**8.1 Determining Your Main Ideas** <span id="8.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Stand up, Speak out: The Practice and Ethics of Public
    Speaking: “Chapter 10, Section 10.1: Determining Your Main Ideas”**
    Link: *Stand up, Speak out: The Practice and Ethics of Public
    Speaking: *[“Chapter 10, Section 10.1: Determining Your Main
    Ideas”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Stand%20Up,%20Speak%20Out%20-%20The%20Practice%20and%20Ethics%20of%20Public%20Speaking.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please read both the Chapter 10 introduction and
    Section 10.1 readings in their entirety, keeping in mind that your
    main points are a combination of your topic, your purpose, and your
    strategy, which is represented by the organizational pattern you
    use.  For example, if your topic is cats and your purpose is to
    inform your audience, then your specific purpose might be to inform
    your audience of the differences in cat breeds.  “Differences” is a
    keyword associated with the strategy and pattern of using contrast. 
    Keep this simple relationship in mind, not only as you read this
    section, but also when you move on to the next.  Attempt the
    questions in the Exercises section at the end of the reading; for
    any questions that require partner or group work, consider working
    with family members or friends.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please read all of Section 10.3, which covers what
    some refer to as the “oil” and the “glue,” elements which create the
    flow and coherence of an effective speech.  Pay particular attention
    to Table 10.1, which provides a comprehensive list of transitional
    phrases that work within specific organizational patterns. 
    Inexperienced speakers often struggle to come up with effective
    phrases.  Used like a thesaurus for finding alternative words, a
    list like that in Table 10.1 can save a great deal of time if you
    have followed one of the standard organizational patterns covered in
    subsection 10.2.  Note that four types of transitional elements are
    covered in this subunit: transitions between main points, internal
    previews, internal summaries, and signpost.  Attempt the exercises
    at the end of the reading.

    (Adobe Flash)  
        
     Instructions: After you have completed all of the readings,
    lectures, and other resources for this unit, respond to all 7
    key-term flashcards linked above.  Click on “Instructions” in the
    shaded bar below the flashcard, and follow the directions and
    options described.  If at any point in reviewing the flashcards you
    are unsure of the answer, refer to the course textbook, Lucas’
    textbook’s summary or outline pages, and/or perform an internet
    search to uncover the answer.  Be aware that if you discover the
    terms used deviate significantly from the textbook readings or the
    lecture, you can click on “Key Terms” in the shaded bar to see the
    complete list of terms and definitions for the set of flashcards. 
    After you have reviewed that list, click on “Start Over” to re-test
    yourself.  Keep in mind that you can choose to a.) see the term and
    provide the definition or b.) see the definition and provide the
    term by toggling the box to the left of the phrase “key term first,”
    located on the right-hand side of the pink shaded bar. To check the
    accuracy of your answers, click on the word “flip” in the lower
    right-hand corner of the flashcard.  This action will turn the card
    over and prompt the system to announce the correct term.  If your
    response was incorrect, click on flashcard box labeled “study
    again.”  This will save the term for you to return to later and then
    turn over a new flashcard.  Once you have completed all of the
    flashcards in the set, if you got any of them incorrect, consider
    reviewing the chapter summary, the reading assignments, and/or the
    lecture again before you click on any of the unshaded boxes in the
    row at the bottom of the flashcard.  The unshaded boxes represent
    key terms you did not identify correctly in your previous attempt
    and give you the opportunity to reinforce your learning experience
    by revisiting those terms.
