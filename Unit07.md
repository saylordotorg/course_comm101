**Unit 7: Supporting Ideas and Building Arguments** <span
id="7"></span> 
**This unit covers topics which establish the substance of your speech. 
What is “substance?”  The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines it as “the
qualities that make a thing what it is,” and that is an appropriate way
to think of the supporting material that should comprise the bulk of
your speech.  Many inexperienced speakers focus their efforts on the
main points or major arguments of their speeches, but only cursorily
attach to those elements synthesis of ideas—the details and connections
which establish their real impact.  The result is that student speeches
tend to use the same type of support, over and over again, creating a
dull sameness that causes the attention of audiences to sag even as they
lose respect for the speaker’s motivations and/or credibility. You can
avoid this syndrome by absorbing not only the function of supporting
details in a speech but also the variety of types and formats you can
choose from to keep your speech interesting and influential.  This unit
will focus on providing you with information and advice on how to use
various types of supporting evidence to strengthen any arguments made in
your speech. **

**Unit 7 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 7 hours to complete.

**7.1.1 Defining "Support"** <span id="7.1.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 7.1. 
Pay attention to the terms used by the textbook when it refers to
supporting detail so that you recognize that it associates both
informative and persuasive supporting elements with the same terms, an
uncommon approach compared to most textbooks.  This topic is discussed
in the unlabeled introductory paragraph of the “Section 8.1: Using
Research as Support” reading.*

**7.1.2 Reasons to Use Support** <span id="7.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 7.1. 
It identifies three reasons why an effective public speaker uses
supporting details: to clarify content, to add credibility, and to add
vividness.  Each of these subtopics is introduced by a heading in the
“Section 8.1: Using Research as Support” reading.*

**7.2 Types of Support** <span id="7.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: Stand up, Speak out: The Practice and Ethics of Public
    Speaking: “Chapter 8, Section 8.2: Exploring Types of Support”**

     Instructions: Please read all of Section 8.2, which provides an
    extensive list of the options you have for finding and presenting a
    variety of types of supporting details.  Keep in mind that the
    textbook refers to both informative details and persuasive evidence
    as “support.”  Attempt the exercises at the end of the reading. 
    Note that this reading covers the topics outlined in subunits 7.2.1
    through 7.2.6, as well as any inclusive sections.

**7.2.1 Facts and Statistics** <span id="7.2.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 7.2
and is introduced by a subheading in the “Section 8.2: Exploring Types
of Support” reading.*

    Instructions: Please watch this 1-minute video, which provides an
    example of statistics used as supporting detail in an actual student
    speech.

**7.2.2 Definitions** <span id="7.2.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 7.2
and is introduced by a subheading in the “Section 8.2: Exploring Types
of Support” reading.  Focus on the distinctions between the four types
of definitions: lexical, persuasive, stipulative, and theoretical.*

    Concepts”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N002WqXXZzk&feature=bf_prev&list=UL2mr3ufQ0m14&lf=mfu_in_order)
    (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Please watch this 1-minute video, which provides an
    example of how to use extended definition to explain a concept in an
    actual student speech.  To understand why explaining a concept is an
    act of definition, you need to realize that a concept is an abstract
    idea; something that cannot be experienced directly and therefore is
    more difficult to understand.  As a result, an effective public
    speaker will define an unfamiliar concept before using it to make
    other points in a speech.  However, because concepts are complex
    ideas, they require more explanation than the unfamiliar words or
    technical terms handled by simple definition.  When a speaker
    explains a concept, he or she is considered to be using an
    *extended *definition, a form of defining which educates an audience
    by using a variety of rhetorical strategies.  Thus, extended
    definition would be categorized by the textbook as a theoretical
    type of definition.

**7.2.3 Examples** <span id="7.2.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 7.2. 
For this subunit, you should focus on the distinctions between the four
types of examples that are based on the qualities they exhibit: positive
examples, negative examples, non-examples, and best examples.  Each type
is introduced by a subheading in the “Section 8.2: Exploring Types of
Support” reading.*

*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 7.2
and is introduced by a subheading in the “Section 8.2: Exploring Types
of Support” reading.  For this subunit, you should focus on the
distinctions between the three types of narratives, each of which is
based on the purpose of the speech: informative narratives, persuasive
narratives, and entertaining narratives.*

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please read all of Section 8.3, which contains a
    great deal of practical information about how to integrate research
    into your own original content.  The seamless integration of
    original and sourced material is the core of truly effective and
    professional communication, so pay particular attention to the forms
    in which sourced material can be presented—summary, paraphrase, and
    quotation—and most importantly, the reasoning and rules you should
    follow when deciding which form to use.  Attempt the exercises at
    the end of the reading to reinforce your understanding of supporting
    and developing arguments.  Note that this reading covers the topics
    outlined in subunits 7.3.1 through 7.3.5, as well as any inclusive
    sections.

**7.3.2 Sifting Through Your Support** <span id="7.3.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 7.3
and is introduced by a subheading in the “Section 8.3: Using Support and
Creating Arguments” reading.  It encompasses five recommendations that
should guide how you handle your supporting details: use a variety of
types of support, choose the appropriate form of support, check that
your support is relevant, do not use redundant supporting details, and
do not manipulate your supporting details.  Pay particular attention to
the bulleted list associated with manipulating details, because
oftentimes inexperienced speakers are not aware of what constitutes the
unethical manipulation of information.*

**7.3.3 Using Support Within Your Speech** <span id="7.3.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 7.3. 
For this subunit, it is important that you recognize that using
information from sources other than yourself is one of the central
ethical challenges in all formats of communication, public and private. 
One important key to surmounting this challenge is the appropriate use
of quotation, paraphrase, and summary.  As you review material in this
subunit that relates to those three forms for handling information, keep
in mind that choosing the right one is not an arbitrary decision: it is
an ethical decision.  This is why you should pay particular attention to
the numbered lists in the reading, which identify the rules to guide you
in choosing the right form of supporting details in your speech.  Note,
also, that two additional forms of support that are less impacted by
ethical considerations are also covered in this section: numeric support
and pictographic support.  Each form is introducing by a subheading in
the “Section 8.3: Using Support and Creating Arguments” reading.*

     Instructions: Watch this 9-minute video as a tutorial assignment in
    which you will read slides covering how to recognize the main points
    and supporting details in reading material and then respond to
    applicable questions.  The answers to the questions are provided 30
    seconds after the question-asking slide.  As you complete this
    tutorial, recognize that although the video was produced for a
    reading course, its contents are very appropriate for public
    speaking students as well, because it focuses on showing you how to
    recognize when you encounter major points and details in the
    materials you review when you are researching topics.  In addition,
    characteristics of writing that signal the presentation of
    supporting details are the same signals you should plan to point out
    when you are providing supporting details for your own audience.

**7.3.4 Evaluate the Adequacy of Your Support** <span
id="7.3.4"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 7.3
and is introduced by a subheading in the “Section 8.3: Using Support and
Creating Arguments” reading.  It introduces two guidelines that may help
you decide whether you have enough supporting details to back up your
main points or claims: work backward from your conclusion to assess
whether you have provided enough support to reach that conclusion and
make sure that every claim you state is associated with details that are
specific and relevant enough to support it.*

**7.3.5 Prepare Your Support's Oral Presentation** <span
id="7.3.5"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 7.3. 
Focus on the three steps you should follow as you prepare the actual
words and statements which present support for an idea, point, or
argument.  Those steps are the set up, the execution, and the analysis,
and they are particularly important, because many speakers do not focus
on the information they are using from their sources, neglecting the
important details about the sources themselves which establish the
credibility and impact of their information.  Each of the steps in
presenting support is introduced by a subheading in the “Section 8.3:
Using Support and Creating Arguments” reading.*

     Instructions: After you have completed all of the readings,
    lectures, and other resources for this unit, respond to all 15
    key-term flashcards linked above.  Click on “Instructions” in the
    shaded bar below the flashcard, and follow the directions and
    options described.  If at any point in reviewing the flashcards you
    are unsure of the answer, refer to the course textbook, Lucas’
    textbook’s summary or outline pages, and/or perform an internet
    search to uncover the answer.  Be aware that if you discover the
    terms used deviate significantly from the textbook readings or the
    lecture, you can click on “Key Terms” in the shaded bar to see the
    complete list of terms and definitions for the set of flashcards. 
    After you have reviewed that list, click on “Start Over” to re-test
    yourself. Keep in mind that you can choose to a.) see the term and
    provide the definition or b.) see the definition and provide the
    term by toggling the box to the left of the phrase “key term first,”
    located on the right-hand side of the pink shaded bar.  To check the
    accuracy of your answers, click on the word “flip” in the lower
    right-hand corner of the flashcard.  This action will turn the card
    over and prompt the system to announce the correct term.  If your
    response was incorrect, click on flashcard box labeled “study
    again.”  This will save the term for you to return to later and then
    turn over a new flashcard.  Once you have completed all of the
    flashcards in the set, if you got any of them incorrect, consider
    reviewing the chapter summary, the reading assignments, and/or the
    lecture again before you click on any of the unshaded boxes in the
    row at the bottom of the flashcard.  The unshaded boxes represent
    key terms you did not identify correctly in your previous attempt
    and give you the opportunity to reinforce your learning experience
    by revisiting those terms.
