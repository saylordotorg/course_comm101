**Unit 14: Speaking to Inform and Entertain** <span id="14"></span> 
*In this unit, you will review and focus more directly on the purposes
of informing and entertaining when giving speeches.  Even though the
topics of this unit often stand on their own as significant sections, in
this course they are shorter because most of the guidance that might be
necessary to develop both informative and entertaining speeches has
already been covered.  Unlike the theory-driven language and approaches
you will discover are associated with persuasive speaking, the language
and approach you take to inform or entertain is driven by you, the
speaker, and your relationship to your audience, your topic, and your
purpose—each of which have been the subject of entire units in this
course already.  As a result, rather than review those subjects, the
material in this unit focuses on the characteristics which make these
two types of speeches distinct.*

**Unit 14 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 5.5 hours to complete.

     Instructions: After you have completed all of the readings,
    lectures and other resources for this unit, respond to all 10
    key-term flashcards in the link noted above. Click on “Instructions”
    in the shaded bar below the flashcard and follow the directions and
    options described. If at any point in reviewing the flashcards you
    are unsure of the answer, refer to the course textbook, Lucas’
    textbook’s summary or outline pages, and/or perform an internet
    search to uncover the answer. Realize that this process of looking
    up terms you do not recognize is the reason why the time advisory
    for this assignment is 30 minutes. Be aware, also, that if you
    discover the terms used deviate significantly from the textbook
    readings or the lecture, you can click on “Key Terms” in the shaded
    bar to see the complete list of terms and definitions for the set of
    flashcards. After you have reviewed that list, click on “Start Over”
    to re-test yourself. Keep in mind that you can choose to a.) see the
    term and provide the definition or b.) see the definition and
    provide the term by toggling the box to the left of the phrase “key
    term first,” located on the right-hand side of the pink shaded bar.
    To check the accuracy of your answers, click on the word “flip” in
    the lower right-hand corner of the flashcard. This action will turn
    the card over and prompt the system to announce the correct term. If
    your response was incorrect, click on flashcard box labeled “study
    again.” This will save the term for you to return to later and then
    turn over a new flashcard. Once you have completed all of the
    flashcards in the set, if you got any of them incorrect, consider
    reviewing the chapter summary, the reading assignments and/or the
    lecture again before you click on any of the unshaded boxes in the
    row at the bottom of the flashcard. The unshaded boxes represent key
    terms you did not identify correctly in your previous attempt and
    give you the opportunity to reinforce your learning experience by
    revisiting those terms.

    broad types of keynote speeches: after-dinner speaking and
    motivational speaking.  Pay particular attention to the list and
    examples of types of humor in Table 18.1 for ideas about what kind

**Unit 14 Assignments and Assessment** <span id="14.3"></span> 
-   **Assignment: McGraw-Hill Higher Education: Steven E. Lucas’ *The
    Art of Public Speaking*: “Chapter 17 – Key-Term Flashcards”**
    Link: McGraw-Hill Higher Education: Steven E. Lucas’ *The Art of
    Public Speaking*: [“Chapter 17 – Key-Term
    Flashcards”](http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/007313564x/student_view0/chapter17/key-term_flashcards.html)
    (Adobe Flash)  
        
     Instructions: After you have completed all of the readings,
    lectures, and other resources for this unit, respond to all 5
    key-term flashcards linked above.  Click on “Instructions” in the
    shaded bar below the flashcard and follow the directions and options
    described.  If at any point in reviewing the flashcards you are
    unsure of the answer, refer to the course textbook, Lucas’
    textbook’s summary or outline pages, and/or perform an internet
    search to uncover the answer.  Be aware that if you discover the
    terms used deviate significantly from the textbook readings or the
    lecture, you can click on “Key Terms” in the shaded bar to see the
    complete list of terms and definitions for the set of flashcards.
    After you have reviewed that list, click on “Start Over” to re-test
    yourself.  Keep in mind that you can choose to a.) see the term and
    provide the definition or b.) see the definition and provide the
    term by toggling the box to the left of the phrase “key term first,”
    located on the right-hand side of the pink shaded bar.  To check the
    accuracy of your answers, click on the word “flip” in the lower
    right-hand corner of the flashcard.  This action will turn the card
    over and prompt the system to announce the correct term.  If your
    response was incorrect, click on flashcard box labeled “study
    again.”  This will save the term for you to return to later and then
    turn over a new flashcard.  Once you have completed all of the
    flashcards in the set, if you got any of them incorrect, consider
    reviewing the chapter summary, the reading assignments, and/or the
    lecture again before you click on any of the unshaded boxes in the
    row at the bottom of the flashcard.  The unshaded boxes represent
    key terms you did not identify correctly in your previous attempt
    and give you the opportunity to reinforce your learning experience
    by revisiting those terms.

     Instructions: After you have completed the preceding flashcard
    assignment, respond to all 17 questions in this self-scoring study
    question quiz, including the last 3 open-ended questions.  You
    should plan to spend about 1 minute on each question.  When you have
    finished, click on the “submit answers” button in the lower
    right-hand corner of your screen, and review how you performed on
    the quiz.  Notice as you do so that any questions you answered
    incorrectly will include a green check mark identifying the correct
    answer, as well as an explanation for that answer presented in
    bold-faced type.  You can also check your answers to the open-ended
    questions at the end of the quiz by comparing them to the bold-faced
    text which will appear in the answer field.  (Note, however, that
    only the multiple choice questions are used to calculate your actual
    quiz score.)
