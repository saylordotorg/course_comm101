**Unit 12: Delivering The Speech** <span id="12"></span> 
*It is not just what you say; it is how you say it.  This is why
understanding the nature of oral delivery and improving your own oral
characteristics are important in ensuring the success of your
presentation.  Few speakers have pitch-perfect delivery.  Actors,
politicians, businessmen and women, and clerics have been known to seek
out delivery coaches to upgrade their oratory.  You will probably not
have access to a speech coach, but if you are determined to present
powerfully delivered speeches, there are two actions you can take to
improve your skills: videotape yourself and seek out opportunities to
deliver public presentations.  Private and public practice will create
self-critiques and public exposure all speakers need to both educate and
motivate them to improve.  There are two ways you can do this.  One is
to consider joining Toastmasters International, a membership-based,
educational organization which shares information about public speaking
and gives speakers opportunities to practice their skills and be
critiqued by other members.  According to the* [*Toastmaster’s
International
website*](http://www.toastmasters.org/Members/MembersFunctionalCategories/AboutTI.aspx)*,
the organization has over a quarter of a million members in 116
countries.  Another way you can get feedback from others about your
public speaking skills is through*
[*OpenStudy.com*](http://openstudy.com/about-us)*, which is described on
its homepage as “a social learning network where students ask questions,
give help, and connect with other students studying the same things.”*

**Unit12 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:  
  
-   Match the distinguishing traits of each delivery mode to the
    justifications for using or avoiding that mode.
-   Match characteristics of the physical setting and other common
    situations of a speech to preparations which would control their
    impact.
-   Convert a speaking outline into effective notecards.
-   Revise a passage from a sample speech such that it possesses
    stronger conversational qualities.
-   Watch several speeches and choose the ones which exhibit the most
    effective use of eye contact and vocals.

     Instructions: Please read both the Chapter 14 introduction and
    Section 14.1 in their entirety.  These readings cover the four ways
    you can deliver a speech.  As you cover the material, pay particular
    attention to the reason why each delivery mode is chosen.  As with
    so much of what you learn and do, you should choose which techniques
    you use based on the needs of your audience and the context, i.e.
    there should be a logical reason for your choices.  Never choose a
    delivery mode based on convenience.  Attempt the questions in the
    Exercises section at the end of the reading; for questions 1 and 2
    that require working with partners or groups, consider asking family
    members or friends to volunteer in helping you complete these
    exercises.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please read Section 14.4 in its entirety, and attempt
    the questions in the Exercises section at the end of the reading. 
    After you read this section, you should recognize that the most
    important guidance it provides comes in the final subsection, which
    involves practicing.  While most speakers recognize the need to
    practice, many fail to realize that even if you have a nearly
    flawless practice session, that one session is insufficient. 
    Practicing a speech many times is not only a matter of remembering
    the content and other actions you have planned; it also involves
    developing what is known as “muscle memory,” which is the ability to
    reproduce an act correctly but without actually thinking about it. 
    The more you practice your speech, the more its intricacies become a
    habit which you can reproduce almost subconsciously.

**Unit 12 Assignment and Assessment** <span id="12.5"></span> 
-   **Assignment: McGraw-Hill Higher Education: Steven E. Lucas’ *The
    Art of Public Speaking*: “Chapter 12 – Key-Term Flashcards”**
    Link: McGraw-Hill Higher Education: Steven E. Lucas’ *The Art of
    Public Speaking*: [“Chapter 12 – Key-Term
    Flashcards”](http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/007313564x/student_view0/chapter12/key-term_flashcards.html)
    (Adobe Flash)  
        
     Instructions: After you have completed all of the readings,
    lectures, and other resources for this unit, respond to all 19
    key-term flashcards linked above.  Click on “Instructions” in the
    shaded bar below the flashcard and follow the directions and options
    described.  If at any point in reviewing the flashcards you are
    unsure of the answer, refer to the course textbook, Lucas’
    textbook’s summary or outline pages, and/or perform an Internet
    search to uncover the answer.  Be aware that if you discover the
    terms used deviate significantly from the textbook readings or the
    lecture, you can click on “Key Terms” in the shaded bar to see the
    complete list of terms and definitions for the set of flashcards. 
    After you have reviewed that list, click on “Start Over” to re-test
    yourself. Keep in mind that you can choose to a.) see the term and
    provide the definition or b.) see the definition and provide the
    term by toggling the box to the left of the phrase “key term first,”
    located on the right-hand side of the pink shaded bar.  To check the
    accuracy of your answers, click on the word “flip” in the lower
    right-hand corner of the flashcard. This action will turn the card
    over and prompt the system to announce the correct term.  If your
    response was incorrect, click on flashcard box labeled “study
    again.”  This will save the term for you to return to later and then
    turn over a new flashcard.  Once you have completed all of the
    flashcards in the set, if you got any of them incorrect, consider
    reviewing the chapter summary, the reading assignments, and/or the
    lecture again before you click on any of the unshaded boxes in the
    row at the bottom of the flashcard.  The unshaded boxes represent
    key terms you did not identify correctly in your previous attempt
    and give you the opportunity to reinforce your learning experience
    by revisiting those terms.

    right-hand corner of your screen, and review how you performed on
    the quiz.  Notice that any questions you answered incorrectly will
    include a green check mark identifying the correct answer, as well
    as an explanation for that answer presented in bold-faced type.  You
    can also check your answers to the open-ended questions at the end
    of the quiz by comparing them to the bold-faced text which will
    appear in the answer field.  (Note, however, that only the
    multiple-choice questions are used to calculate your actual quiz
    score.)
