**Unit 1: Why Public Speaking Matters Today** <span id="1"></span> 
*If you are reading this material in or within a few years of 2011, you
probably remember the public protests which rocked the world.  In
northern Africa, in the United States, in Russia and in many other
countries, people protesting their governments’ decision-making
dominated the news sections of many media outlets.  These
protests—literally “mass” communication: from people to people—represent
just one of many reasons why public speaking matters today.  Although it
can now take on many forms and formats, from standing in front of a
crowd to tweeting, emailing, posting on a social media site, or
commenting in the discussion area after a news article, communicating in
public matters today for the same reason has always mattered, because it
can be one of the most effective ways for the voices of the people to be
heard.  Recognize, however, that due to the primary textbook this course
utilizes, the material in this unit approaches public speaking with an
inevitably American cultural bias.  Moreover, it is unethical to force
one’s cultural biases onto others and expect them to conform.  The
content which ends this unit covers the topic of ethics in public
speaking, completing this introductory examination of the subject in a
manner that should encourage you to become more aware of and sensitive
about such issues, which also illustrate why public speaking matters
today.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 8 hours to complete.

     Please read the Chapter 1 introduction and Section 1.1 for an

    this reading covers the topics outlined in subunits 1.1.1 and 1.1.2,
    as well as any inclusive sections.

**1.1.1 Three Types of Public Speaking** <span id="1.1.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 1.1. 
As with most of the subunits in this course, you will find that the
topic has been divided into distinct subtopics.  The course introduction
noted that this is a useful trait of the textbook which you should take
advantage of.  Therefore, to cover this topic of subunit 1.1.1, you
should pay particular attention to the distinguishing features of each
of the three types of public speaking covered in this subunit:
informative, persuasive, and entertaining.  Each type is introduced by a
subheading in the “Section 1.1: Why Is Public Speaking Important?”
reading.*

**1.1.2 Personal Benefits of Public Speaking** <span id="1.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 1.1
and is introduced by a subheading in the “Section 1.1: Why Is Public
Speaking Important?” reading.  To absorb this topic efficiently, you
should focus on developing a list of the personal benefits of public
speaking based on the readings in this section.*

**1.2 The Process of Public Speaking** <span id="1.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: Stand up, Speak out: The Practice and Ethics of Public
    Speaking: “Chapter 1, Section 1.2: The Process of Public Speaking”**

     (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please read Section 1.2, which will enable you to
    identify the three most important elements which influence the
    process of public speaking.  The section also provides a brief
    introduction to several important models of public speaking,
    including the Shannon and Weaver model of communication.  Models
    attempt to diagram how the elements of a process interact and to
    explain outcomes.  Like checklists, models are useful reminders of
    the elements you should consider, anticipate, adjust, and, if
    possible, adapt to if you are planning a speech.  Attempt the
    exercises at the end of the reading (think of question 2
    hypothetically, keeping in mind what speech you may want to
    deliver).  Please note that this reading covers the topics outlined
    in subunits 1.2.1 and 1.2.2, as well as any inclusive sections.

**1.2.1 Models of Public Speaking** <span id="1.2.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 1.2.
 For this topic, you should note the distinguishing features of each of
the two models of public speaking: interactional and transactional.

speaking helps to explain three relationships: the contrasting
relationship of dialogue and monologue; the relationship between
meaning, people, and words; and the relationship between contexts and
social situations.  The latter relationship itself can be further broken
down into four dimensions: physical, temporal, social psychological, and
cultural.  Each relationship and dimension is introduced by a subheading
in the “Section 1.2: The Process of Public Speaking” reading.*
