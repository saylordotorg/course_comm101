**Unit 10: Outlining** <span id="10"></span> 
*This unit explores the use of outlining in preparation for giving a
speech.  In this unit and the next, consider critically the authors’
recommendation to favor sentence outlines over keyword outlines.
 Sometimes, the use of sentence outlines needs to be balanced with an
inexperienced speaker’s tendency to produce a manuscript rather than a
speech.  Unit 11 will emphasize using language designed for the ear
rather than the eye when presenting a speech.  Many would argue that
sentence outlines can interfere with that process.  Moreover, sentence
outlines allow a speaker to be less familiar with a topic and thus less
flexible in presenting it, even if, as the textbook also recommends, the
sentence outline is converted to keywords and phrases on cue cards.
 Lastly, sentence outlines can make a speaker dependent on pre-planned
phrasing rather than addressing the audience through a natural,
conversational style.  As a result of these potential pitfalls, pay
particular attention to the “tricks” described at the end of the
chapter, which are designed to avoid reliance on reading and/or on words
that were originally written “for the eye rather than the ear.”*

**10.1 The Benefits of Outlining** <span id="10.1"></span>

    Speaking: “Chapter 12, Section 12.1: Why Outline?"**

    Outline?”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Stand%20Up,%20Speak%20Out%20-%20The%20Practice%20and%20Ethics%20of%20Public%20Speaking.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please read both the Chapter 12 introduction and
    Section 12.1 in their entirety.  These readings introduce aspects of
    outlining that are rarely discussed in depth, but which can be
    particularly helpful in enabling a speaker to evaluate his or her
    plans before finalizing the contents of a speech. Specifically, pay
    particular attention to the material on how outlines can be used to
    test the scope, logic, relevance and balance of the content you have
    planned.  Complete the exercises at the end of the reading in order
    to reinforce what you have learned in this subunit.

    they listen to the instructor’s lecture.  This summary is similar to
    the abbreviated discussion of the chapter’s details which Dr.
    Phillips’ lecture also presents.  As a result, reviewing it will
    enable you to follow the lecture more effectively.

    Outlines”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Stand%20Up,%20Speak%20Out%20-%20The%20Practice%20and%20Ethics%20of%20Public%20Speaking.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please read Section 12.2 in its entirety.  This
    reading continues the emphasis on sentence outlines begun in the
    previous subunit while shifting focus onto the three functional
    types (working outline, full sentence outline, and speaking outline)
    rather than format types.  Pay particular attention to the examples
    of each type of outline, presenting in shaded boxes in the text.  In
    addition, remember the advice given previously and base your
    decisions on which format of outlining you require (regardless of
    function) on how independent you can be from statements you have
    written out fully in previous incarnations of the speech.  If you
    cannot liberate yourself from those drafts, you may want to avoid
    writing complete sentences at any point in your preparations, except
    when presenting the contents of direct quotes from your sources. 
    Attempt the questions in the Exercises section at the end of the
    reading.

**10.3 Using Outlining for Success** <span id="10.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: Stand up, Speak out: The Practice and Ethics of Public
    Speaking: “Chapter 12, Section 12.3: Using Outlining for Success”**
    Link: *Stand up, Speak out: The Practice and Ethics of Public

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please read this brief Section 12.3, which covers
    five finer points to develop in your outlines: singularity,
    consistency, adequacy, uniformity, and parallelism.  Keep in mind
    that putting such finishing touches on an outline represents an
    effort to refine and revisit your plans, the result of which is an
    even greater familiarity with what you have planned as well as an
    increasing confidence in the decisions you have made.  Such
    familiarity and confidence will in turn influence the ease and
    confidence with which you deliver your speech.  Attempt the
    exercises at the end of the reading.

    Art of Public Speaking*: “Chapter 10 – Key-Term Flashcards”**
    Link: McGraw-Hill Higher Education: Steven E. Lucas’ *The Art of
    Public Speaking*: [“Chapter 10 – Key-Term
    Flashcards”](http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/007313564x/student_view0/chapter10/key-term_flashcards.html)
    (Adobe Flash)  
        
     Instructions: After you have completed all of the readings,
    lectures, and other resources for this unit, respond to all 5
    key-term flashcards linked above.  Click on “Instructions” in the
    shaded bar below the flashcard, and follow the directions and
    options described.  If at any point in reviewing the flashcards you
    are unsure of the answer, refer to the course textbook, Lucas’
    textbook’s summary or outline pages, and/or perform an Internet
    search to uncover the answer.  Be aware that if you discover the
    terms used deviate significantly from the textbook readings or the
    lecture, you can click on “Key Terms” in the shaded bar to see the
    complete list of terms and definitions for the set of flashcards. 
    After you have reviewed that list, click on “Start Over” to re-test
    yourself. Keep in mind that you can choose to a.) see the term and
    provide the definition or b.) see the definition and provide the
    term by toggling the box to the left of the phrase “key term first,”
    located on the right-hand side of the pink shaded bar. To check the
    accuracy of your answers, click on the word “flip” in the lower
    right-hand corner of the flashcard.  This action will turn the card
    over and prompt the system to announce the correct term.  If your
    response was incorrect, click on flashcard box labeled “study
    again.”  This will save the term for you to return to later and then
    turn over a new flashcard.  Once you have completed all of the
    flashcards in the set, if you got any of them incorrect, consider
    reviewing the chapter summary, the reading assignments, and/or the
    lecture again before you click on any of the unshaded boxes in the
    row at the bottom of the flashcard.  The unshaded boxes represent
    key terms you did not identify correctly in your previous attempt
    and give you the opportunity to reinforce your learning experience
    by revisiting those terms.

    finished, click on the “submit answers” button in the lower
    right-hand corner of your screen, and review how you performed on
    the quiz.  Notice that any questions you answered incorrectly will
    include a green check mark identifying the correct answer, as well
    as an explanation for that answer presented in bold-faced type.  You
    can also check your answers to the open-ended questions at the end
    of the quiz by comparing them to the bold-faced text which will
    appear in the answer field. (Note, however, that only the
    multiple-choice questions are used to calculate your actual quiz
    score.)
